\title{Update the R Code Development Tracker File ("SuiteMFMR" DevTools)}
\usage{
devs.patch.code.dev.trckr.file(sbIsProdRel = FALSE, sbAudioNote = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{sbIsProdRel}{(\link{logical}) A boolean value that defines whether the code-check and/or code
commit process (action) is a "Production Release" action or not.}

\item{sbAudioNote}{(\link{logical}) A boolean value that specifies whether an audio notification
should be played at the completion of this function's code execution (upon
successful patching \if{html}{\out{<updating>}} of the "Active Development Information Tracker
File").}
}
\value{
\itemize{
\item This function programmatically amends \if{html}{\out{<patches or updates>}} the active (i.e. regent) R Library
Project's Code Development Tracking Information (i.e. tracker file) for code versioning and
project (i.e. library code) development tracking purposes.
}
}
\description{
A Helper Function that updates important information inside the "Active Development Information
Tracker File" (i.e. "00_ACT_DEV_TRCKR.txt") located in the active project's development or
launchpad folder (i.e. the "./WIP/" path or directory). This "Active Development Information
Tracker File" will be programmatically initialized (created) by this helper function if not
found in the default project directory (i.e. "./WIP/" project folder).
}
\examples{
\dontrun{   ### <- This function constitutes a development utility !!! This function requires a 
            ###    special code development directory ("./WIP") created during the init-run (i.e.
            ###    initial R project setup) phase and is intended to facilitate a user-friendly
            ###    R Library development process. For these reasons the code examples below
            ###    should not be executed during normal "R_CMD_CHECK" code check procedures.
            
### Run R Package DevCode easily as follows ...
library(MFMRutils)   # <- Loads "MFMRutils" library (if already installed) !!!

### Run 2 different types of code check/validation processes ...
devs.patch.code.dev.trckr.file()   # -> Executes only the DevTools Documentation 
                                   #    Process.
                                   
}
